# Palmora Group HR Analytics Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
### This case study examines HR data for **Palmora Group**, a Nigerian manufacturing company facing allegations of gender inequality. To support data-driven HR policies, the analysis finds trends in rating, bonus distribution, gender distribution, and pay disparities.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Power BI** (for dashboards & visualizations)
- **Excel** (Data cleaning and wrangling)
- **GitHub** (portfolio hosting)

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- `Palmora_HR_Dataset.xlsx` – Employee demographics, salaries, ratings
- `Bonus_Rules.xlsx` – Rules for calculating performance-based bonuses

## 🏢 Business Context
### Palmora is growing globally, but the company has been criticized by the public for gender inequality. The CHRO assigned analysts to investigate wage compliance, gender equity, and salary fairness.

## 🔍 My Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filled missing genders with `"Undisclosed"`.
   - Removed employees with no salary or invalid departments.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Gender and regional distribution
   - Performance ratings by gender
   - Salary banding and minimum wage compliance
   - Gender pay gap across departments and regions
   - Bonus allocation is based on rating

3. **Visualization**:
   - Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with slicers and bar charts
   - Highlighted key compliance gaps and pay imbalances

## 📈 Key Findings
- Females were underrepresented in leadership and high-paying positions.
- Bonus distributions and allocations differed significantly by gender.
- The manufacturing and sales divisions had a gender pay disparity.
- Many employees earned less than the required minimum wage of $90,000, particularly in Region X.


## ✅ Recommendations
- Standardize pay bands and carrying out of internal pay audits regularly.
- Encourage more inclusive hiring and advancement procedures.
- Make specific wage changes in areas that do not comply.
- Apply performance reviews more fairly when allocating bonuses.
